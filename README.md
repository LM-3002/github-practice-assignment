# Github Practice Assignment in Week 2 BIOS 4401
## Goals:
In this class I really want to familiarize myself with the functions of coding 
and sharing that coding in science. Further, I want to familiarize myself with 
data cleaning and manipulation which will help with my current project and 
future projects. 
Reproducibility is incredibly important, but if I absolutely
NEEDED to choose the most important reason it would be the transparency. 
It both helps make sure that the scientists are doing their science correctly, 
from allowing for fraud or mistakes to be caught, as well as allows others to 
use one's data and methods for future study.
